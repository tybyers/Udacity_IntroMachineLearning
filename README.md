## Project Deliverables

The grader or other viewer may find my applicable project deliverables at:

 * Final Project Write-up: **Question_Responses.ipynb** or [iPython Notebook Viewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/tybyers/Udacity_IntroMachineLearning/blob/master/Question_Responses.ipynb)
 * Pickle files: **my_dataset.pkl**, **my_classifier.pkl**, **my_feature_list.pkl**
 * Machine Learning file: **poi_id.py** (run this file if needed)
 * Tester file: **tester.py** (unmodified from Udacity-distributed code)
 * References: **References.md** 
 
## Other files in this repo:

 * **workflow.ipynb** -- My workflow -- test code, charts, rough draft. Fairly unstructured. View at [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/tybyers/Udacity_IntroMachineLearning/blob/master/workflow.ipynb)
 * **./tools** -- Udacity-provided tools directory.  Moved to this repo in case the grader just wants to clone the repo to run code.
 * **final_project_dataset.pkl** -- Udacity-provided dataset
 * **enron_exploration.(Rmd/html/pdf)** -- Conducted some bit of EDA in RStudio at the beginning of the project.  These are the applicable files.
 * **dataset.csv** -- Basically the final_project_dataset.pkl in csv format -- for the RStudio EDA
 * **parameter\_tuning\_(learnrate/nestimators).png** -- Figures for metrics used when parameter tuning. Show up in final project write-up.
